<p>In JavaScript, variables are essential because they allow developers to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. Imagine variables as labeled containers that hold various types of data, such as numbers, strings, or objects. This capability is foundational for developing dynamic and interactive web applications. In this topic, we will explore how to declare variables.</p><h5 id="what-is-a-variable">What is a variable?</h5><p>A <strong>variable</strong> is a designated space in memory where data can be stored, accessed, and manipulated. Think of a variable as a box with a label, allowing you to identify and retrieve its contents when needed. Each variable has a unique name, which distinguishes it from others.</p><h5 id="how-to-declare-a-variable">How to declare a variable?</h5><p>Before using a variable, you should declare it, which means creating it and optionally assigning it a value. JavaScript provides two modern keywords for declaring variables:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-javascript">let</code> defines a <strong>mutable</strong> variable, whose value you can change.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-javascript">const</code> declares a <strong>constant</strong> variable, which prevents value overwriting.</p></li></ul><p style="text-align: start;">When declaring a variable, name it appropriately. Assign a name that describes its contents. Choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.</p><h5 id="mutable-variables">Mutable variables</h5><p>Let's create a mutable variable and explore why it's called mutable. Let's name it <code class="language-javascript">month</code> and assign data to it using the <code class="language-javascript">=</code> symbol:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November"; // declare the variable and assign it a value</code></pre><p>In JavaScript, variables store any type of data. Here, you've stored the string <code class="language-javascript">November</code>. You can access this string using the variable name:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November";
console.log(month); // outputs the content of the variable to the console</code></pre><p>This code displays the variable's content in the console. In our case, the result will be the string <code class="language-javascript">November</code>. Try it out yourself.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Variable names are case-sensitive: <code class="language-javascript">month</code> differs from <code class="language-javascript">Month</code>.</p></div><p>Now, let's try to change the variable and print its new value to the console:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">let month = "November";
month = "December";

console.log(month); // December</code></pre><p>Notice how the variable's value has changed. It now holds the string <code class="language-javascript">December</code>.</p><h5 id="constants">Constants</h5><p>Using <code class="language-javascript">const</code>, we can declare immutable variables. For example, we can declare the immutable variable <code class="language-javascript">language</code> and assign it the string <code class="language-javascript">JavaScript</code> as its value:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const language = "JavaScript";</code></pre><p>If we wanted to change the value of a variable created with the <code class="language-javascript">const</code> keyword, we would get an error:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const language = "JavaScript";
language = "PHP"; // error</code></pre><p>With this understanding of variables, you can build more complex and engaging programs.</p><h5 id="other-ways-to-declare-variables">Other ways to declare variables</h5><p>In older scripts, you may notice that the keyword <code class="language-javascript">var</code> is used instead of <code class="language-javascript">let</code>. This keyword served to declare variables before <code class="language-javascript">let</code> and <code class="language-javascript">const</code> were introduced in the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) standard. Its syntax looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">var age = 21;</code></pre><p>Variables declared with <code class="language-javascript">let</code> or <code class="language-javascript">const</code> are limited to the block where they are defined. In contrast, variables declared with <code class="language-javascript">var</code> are accessible throughout the entire function, even outside the block where they are declared. This can cause unintended variable pollution. Additionally, variables declared with <code class="language-javascript">var</code> can lead to variable hoisting and potential bugs or errors due to accidental redeclaration. Therefore, it's advisable to use <code class="language-javascript">let</code> or <code class="language-javascript">const</code> in modern JavaScript for more predictable behavior.</p><p>You can also find code where variables are declared without keywords:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">age = 21;</code></pre><p>This is not good practice, either.</p><h5 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h5><ul><li><p>Use <code class="language-javascript">const</code> by default to declare variables. Switch to <code class="language-javascript">let</code> only when you need to reassign the variable's value.</p></li><li><p>Avoid using <code class="language-javascript">var</code>, as it can lead to unexpected behavior due to its function scope and hoisting characteristics.</p></li><li><p>Refrain from declaring variables without keywords, as this can inadvertently create global variables and lead to potential conflicts.</p></li></ul><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Variables are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing developers to store and manipulate data in an organized way. With variables, it is possible to create more complex and exciting programs. Remember to choose meaningful and readable names for your variables to make your code easy to understand. Ensure you use the correct syntax to declare variables as mutable (<code class="language-javascript">let</code>) or immutable (<code class="language-javascript">const</code>), as each type has its unique characteristics. By mastering variables, you will be one step closer to becoming a proficient programmer.</p>
